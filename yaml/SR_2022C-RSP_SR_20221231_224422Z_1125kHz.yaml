  \ 'New Year's memories 2022/23'; while Europe approached midnight and the SVK transmitters\
  \ their final shutdown, Californian stations broadcast their afternoon programmes;\
  \ thus the 'New Year's memories 2022/23' represent a unique package with synchronous\
  \ snapshots of the AM spectrum at several different sites of the world."
